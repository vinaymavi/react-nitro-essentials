# React Nitro Essentials - Extension Pack for VS Code

Inspired by John Papa's [Angular Essentials](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials), this extension pack for Visual Studio Code adds the necessary extensions that will setup your IDE for getting productive with development in React.

## Recommended Settings

Prettier settings

```json
  "prettier.singleQuote": true,
	"prettier.printWidth": 100,
```

## Included

Here is the list of extensions the pack includes:

[React Nitro Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=areai51.react-nitro-snippets) - Snippets to accelerate your React App Development.

[ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - Integrates ESLint into VS Code.

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) VS Code plugin for prettier/prettier, which formats code consistently

[Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) This extension will display inline in the editor the size of the imported package. The extension utilizes webpack with babili-webpack-plugin in order to detect the imported size.

[Editor Config](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - EditorConfig for VS Code. Great for maintaining consistent editor settings.

[Chrome Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) - VS Code debugger for Chrome.

[Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames. Hopefully, VS Code will bake this in at some point. Until then, this is a keeper.
